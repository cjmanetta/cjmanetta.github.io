  <p>Hi! I'm a full stack developer and graphic designer looking for a full-time developer job in the Bay Area. I love to create beautiful and functional web applications and I'm crazy about getting the details right. I can work with Ruby, Rails and JavaScript including JS frameworks like React and I love to learn new languages and web technologies.</p>
