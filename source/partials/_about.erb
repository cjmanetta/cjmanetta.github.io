      <h3>DEVELOPER | DESIGNER | SOCCER COACH</h3>
      <p>I am a graphic designer and aspiring web developer located in the bay area. I am currently attending Dev Bootcamp and I expect to graduate in August 2015 with all of the skills necessary to become a full stack web developer.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for beautiful and functional graphic design and five years of experience working in design, IT and customer service departments of a small company. I have been involved in every aspect of the design process from idea generation through to production and implementation. I am hoping to use my background in graphic design to offer a unique perspective in the world of web development.</p>
