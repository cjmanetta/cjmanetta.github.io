  <h1>FEEDBACK</h1>
  <h2>MON 5/11/2015</h2>
  <section>
    <p>I had some dynamite partners in my first few pairing sessions and I think it really gave me a good foundation to accept that this is just part of the process of learning and working in this industry. I benefitted from their knowledge and I think they benefitted from mine and we made progress on the projects that we worked on. When I started recieving feedback from them it was overwhlemingly positive and constructive. I didn't expect that I would feel this open to constructive criticism right away--but they made it easy!</p>
    <p>After the first 4 or so pairing sessions I had my first negative experience and then a few more. Only one of them was completely frustratring, during the session I felt useless and lost, after the session I felt that I had gone backwards. After a days break I was able to bounce back and learn from it. My pair and I were not prepared for the challenge and that is what caused the problem.</p>
    <p>After that I had several more sessions that confused me about as much as they helped, even after changing my routine to be more prepared for the session. So my entusiasm for pairing has waned and thats been the most frustrating thing for me. Going into week 6 I'm hoping to turn it around and have some more positive experiences!
    </p>
    <p>Giving feedback has been pretty smooth. I work hard to make sure that the constructive feedback is not indtimidating and is something that they can really implement in their work. I really enjoy the process of writing about the best parts of pairing with someone. It puts the whole session into perspective and allows me to review the same things about myself.</p>
    <p>The feedback I have receieved from my pairs has been very encouraging and I think that I am definitley a better pair for receiving it. Unfortunately, I didn't have the same reaction to my feedback for my first solo challange. I  need to figure out how to make that constructive for myself so it doesn't affect my work and my pairing in a negative way.</p>
