  <h1>DBC HERE I COME...</h1>

      In the past few weeks leading up to this experience I have been equal parts scared out of my mind, excited and worried about my decision to embark on this. But when I read or hear about the learning culture at DBC - like in Shareef's fireside chat - my anxiety level subsides and I realize that the DBC philosophy aligns with what I think an educational environment should be - immersive, supportive and demanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think DBC is a place where I can really dig in, be open and honest with myself and come away with a deep understanding of what it takes to be a developer. I love to code, I want make a living doing what I love and I need a confident first step into this world - I'm gonna make that happen for myself at DBC.
