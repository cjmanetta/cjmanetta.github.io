  <h1 id="blogTitle">BLOG</h1>
  <p id="blogIntro">Welcome to my blog! Four words I never thought I would write. This is my first experience with blogging&ndash;ever. So hopefully I'll get better. Until then, I'll be awkwardly chronicalling my days at DBC and trying to sum up my take on the concepts and the culture. Enjoy</p>

      <h2>POSTED SAT 5/23/2015</h2>
      <p>So imagine this - I’m at DBC in a pair and the stakes are high - we are up against a deadline and the material is unfamiliar. I ask myself if I am as reasonably prepared as my partner. The answer comes back, yes...</p></a>

      <h2>POSTED SUN 5/18/2015</h2>
      <p>Classes, in terms of how they model real world objects, are relatively easy to conceptualize. A cat object can reasonably be expected to be a member for Cat class and to have access to cat-like attributes and behaviors. I’ve gone through the ins and outs of classes in fair detail here so I won’t go into again.</p></a>

    <h2>POSTED SUN 5/18/2015</h2>
    <p>Stereotype threat is just one of many self-sabotaging traps that you can fall into in competitive workplace and educational environments.  But I would guess that its one of the more elusive.</p></a>

    <h2>POSTED MON 5/11/2015</h2>
    <p> If programming languages only had their built-in objects, functions and methods they would be incredibly boring and tedious to work with. The fun stuff starts when you create your own methods and functions to do whatever you need in your program. But creating new objects and defining methods will only get you so far. </p></a>

    <h2>POSTED SUN 5/10/2015</h2>
    <p> I had some dynamite partners in my first few pairing sessions and I think it really gave me a good foundation to accept that this is just part of the process of learning and working in this industry.</p></a>

    <p> It takes the object that is its receiver, yields its contents to a code block one at a time and then returns a new object (an array). Thats it!</p></a>

    <a href="c4-tech-issues.html"><h3 class= "listing">WHY MY INTERNET SUCKS...</h3>
    <h2>POSTED SUN 5/3/2015</h2>
    <p>The internet is not broken" said one of the Republican comissioners at the FCC during the net neutrality fight "There is no problem to solve". I am sure that he is wrong, and the way I know is that all of the internet that I have ever consumed in this country has been slow, expensive and unreliable. The question of why, is a whole other matter -- is it lack of infrastructure investment, is it too much regulation, is it not enough, is it lack of innovation or technical limitations?</p></a>
