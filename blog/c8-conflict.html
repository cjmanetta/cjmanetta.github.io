  <h1>CONFLICT</h1>
  <h2>SUN 5/31/2015</h2>
  <section>
    <p>This conflict pretty recent and still a little raw so I'm hoping this process will help me work through it a bit. I coach a recreational youth soccer team that has a group of kids with mixed skill level and commitment to playing. This season we decided to move to a competative league and have tryouts. A few of the parents were not in agreement about this choice but they tried out anyways. One family has twins where one child made the team and one didnt. This totally killed me, i've known them for almost five years since they were 7. But one of their kids just doesn't seem to like it and I can't motivate her to play most of time.</p>
    <p>Today I called to notify the family and the father gave me an earful. I expressed how hard this was for me to chose and how I wish that it didn't come to this but he was interested in hearing me.<p>
    <p>Initially I felt completely defeated and I am still going back and forth between blaming myself for his reaction and feeling really sad for his daughters. I am also angry that he was not more understanding and appreciative of everything I have done for them over they years.</p>
    <p>I don't think I can really do anything else to solve this conflict. Its just the kind of thing where I have to wait until people cool off and just give it some time.</p>
    <p>If I could go back, I would not have had a conversation with him about it. I would have opted for email communicaiton to avoid the conflict. I don't think that it really helped me or helped him to argue about it.</p>
    <p>I took this whole thing pretty hard and I'm hoping that over time it will feel better. I'm not sure that I learned a lot from it, except that sometimes you just have to choose between terrible options.</p>
