  <h1>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF VERSION CONTROL, GITHUB &amp; GIT</h1>
  <h2>POSTED 4/12/2015</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>VERSION CONTROL</h3>
      <p>
        Version control is a system that is used to save states of a file or project so that changes and updates can be more easily managed. Version control, if done properly, allows the author or authors to roll back to earlier versions if the current one is not usable or preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can see where a version control system is critical for developers. If you are working on a writing project and you aren't saving different states of the file, you may lose changes, but the writing is still readable and the changes can be recreated. Once you go down an experimental path with your code, you can end up with something that doesn't function very quickly and it can be hard to walk back your steps to something that runs.
      </p>
    <h3>GIT &amp; TRACKING CHANGES</h3>
      <p>
          Git helps you keep track of changes in a number of ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 1. you can create separate copies--called branches--of your project to mess around on without changing the original until you are ready</li>
        <li> 2. git allows you to add your changes to a queue--called the staging area--so that you can decide what changes you want to implement and if you want to thematically bundle them together</li>
        <li> 3. when you commit changes, git saves a snapshot of just the changes to your project</li>
        <li> 4. when you commit changes you are prompted to add a message so that when you look back in your history--or git log--you can see why a change was made and committed</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>WHY GITHUB?</h3>
      <p>
          GitHub is a web-based host for version controlled projects. GitHub hosted projects can be worked on collaboratively and remotely by teams of developers or by individuals hoping to contribute. GitHub hosts the most up-to-date version of a project that can be downloaded and manipulated by anyone with the rights to do so. This tool has made social coding possible and extremely popular.
