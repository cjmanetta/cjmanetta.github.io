  <h1>WHY MY INTERNET SUCKS...</h1>
  <h2>SUN 5/3/2015 | LAGGING US INTERNET SPEEDS &amp; NET NEUTRALITY</h2>


  <section>
    <p>For the past ten years or so the US has rated relatively lower than a lot of the developed world in internet speed and higher in the cost of service. Some people and corporations have denied that its a problem at all. "The internet is not broken" said one of the Republican comissioners at the FCC during the net neutrality fight "There is no problem to solve".</p>
    <p>I am sure that he is wrong, and the way I know is that all of the internet that I have ever consumed in this country has been slow, expensive and unreliable. The question of why, is a whole other matter -- is it lack of infrastructure investment, is it too much regulation, is it not enough, is it lack of innovation or technical limitations?</p>
    <p>I would say that this problem is largely due to the economic environment in the US and a lack of political will. I refuse to believe that we don't have the ability or the know how right at this very moment to be a global leader in internet speeds and accessiblity.</p>
    <p>So that leaves a few options...</p>
    <h3>LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
    <p>Particularly in rural areas this is a pretty big barrier becuase the incentive is just not there for ISPs to update infrastructure. Rural areas mean not as many customers, not as many customer means not enough of a return on investment for private companies. But in more populated areas the incentive is there so why don't we have better broadband in the Bay Area for instance? It could be that existing utiltiy companies own the rights of way that ISPs may need to update network infrastructure or it may just be that lack of competition has led these companies to see this investment as unnecessary. Where else are customers going to go after all?</p>
    <h3>THE DEVIL ON YOUR LEFT OR THE DEVIL ON YOUR RIGHT</h3>
    <p>Comcast, Verizon or AT&amp;T? Who cares, they are pretty much all the same. The speeds are way less than we know is possible, their pricing structures and agressive sales tactics make people who just want internet and not bundles feel like aliens and when things break and you have to use their technical support it just about as pleasant as getting a cavity filled. What we need is more choice!</p>
    <h3>NET NEUTRALITY IS GOOD, BUT ITS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER</h3>
    <p>After the high profile debates of the past year, some aspects of net neutrality have become a reality in the US. The most significant provision in the new law is to give internet service providers <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier">"comman carrier"</a> regulatory status in an effort to prevent the blocking of specific traffic. That is awesome, don't get me wrong, but what we need in the long run is to encourage innovation in the communications industry by lowering the barriers to entry for new internet providers.</p>
