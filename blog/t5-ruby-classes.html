    <p>If programming languages only had their built-in objects, functions and methods they would be incredibly boring and tedious to work with. The fun stuff starts when you create your own methods and functions to do whatever you need in your program. But creating new objects and defining methods will only get you so far. Take this example...</p>
    <p>Problem: You need to keep track of all the 1800 animals in the national zoo and their various habitat requirements, diets , favorite toys, medical history etc.</p>
    <p>You could approach this by creating each animal as an object and then defining methods and variables to track all of the different types of data associated with them. But then you would have to do that 1800 times--eek.</p>
    <p>Instead, you realize that all of the animals are going to share certain types of data points like diet and exercise needs and that subsections of animals are going to have even more specific things in common. All of the monkeys will need to have climbing appartus, all of the animals with teeth will need to have information on their dental care etc.</p>
    <p>This is where classes come in. They are like templates that allow you to create new objects with all sorts of behaviors built-in to their definition. Classes are an integral part of creating organized and scalable code in Ruby.</p>
    <p>Lets walk through a simple example of a program for the national zoo with only a few types of data and one class just to see how it works...
    <img src="https://gist.github.com/9cf675c2b54e72c97f99.git" alt="code snippet"/>
    <p>As you can see in this example I am creating a class Animal which accepts one or two arguments and includes a method setting the habitat to climbing apparatus if the type of animal is a primate. So lets break it down a bit.</p>
    <p>Attr_reader is setting up two instance variables habitat and diet which can be used by any method inside of the class and can be read using the dot notation on the object outside of the class -- ex. the call for monkey.diet outside of the class returns "fruit".</p>
    <p>The initialize method triggers when the new object is created--Animal.new-- and takes one or two arguments. By setting a default for diet it allows me to create a new animal object only passing in the type. The new object then has the value "fruit" for diet.</p>
    <p>The create_habitat method tests to see if the type of animal is a primate and then assigns "climbing apparatus" as the value for the habitat. This method can now be called outside of the class on our new Animal object assigned to the variable monkey using dot noation-- monkey.create_habiat -- to return the monkey's new habitat.</p>
    <p>Of course this is a very simple example, but it shows the basic structure of a class and the common usage of instance variable and the initialize method.</p>
