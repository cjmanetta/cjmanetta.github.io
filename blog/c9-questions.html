  <h1>QUESTIONS</h1>
  <h2>SUN 6/7/2015</h2>
  <section>
    <p>When I started my first real job doing graphic design and IT support for a bakery, I bombed nearly every complicated question I asked of my superiors. Generally I would start my question somehwere in the middle, wherever my brain was in trying to figure out the problem. For some reason I expected the person I was asking to magically know the context.</p>
    <p>Of course, I would get a confused (and slightly annoyed) look from my boss. So then I would launch into an explaination. But that wasn't much better because I would start in the details and work backwards. That might be fine if you are going through that whole process in your head, but I was doing it out loud and driving my boss crazy.</p>
    <p>So I had to learn to stop myself and start from the beginning- to consider who I was talking to and what the pertinent information was. The same things apply when asking technical questions online or in person. Who is the audience? What information do they need and in what order?<p>
    <p>Its also important to put the context aside and think about the broader themes of your qestion. I came across this a lot when googling issues during phase 0. Many times, my first attempt at a search was too specific to my situation-once I thought about my problem in the context of another example, I was able to find solution.</p>
