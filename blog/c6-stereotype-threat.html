  <h1>STEREOTYPE THREAT</h1>
  <h2>SUN 5/18/2015</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Stereotype threat is just one of many self-sabotaging traps that you can fall into in competitive workplace and educational environments.  But I would guess that its one of the more elusive. I think I can recognize when I am feeling like an imposter but struggling with something because of a internalized, socially-informed self perception? Thats a mouthful to even define much less recognize and manage in yourself.</p>
    <p>I would say that I have at times, in the educational and professional spheres of my life, had a bit of an inferiority complex. But I donâ€™t know that I could pin those struggles on stereotype threat. I suppose that upon closer examination, its the unexpectedness of this threat that makes it so hard to recognize.</p>
    <p>I think that I only really have a reference for this is in sports. I have played soccer since I was very small and I spent a lot of time learning to play in pick-up games with men. Many times I was the only woman and sometimes many years younger than the other players. I nearly always surprised them with my ability and aggressiveness - and it was that underestimation that made me play harder. Its kind of the opposite outcome of the stereotype threat. I think that is how I would combat stereotype threat, meet it head on and use it to drive me towards my goals.
