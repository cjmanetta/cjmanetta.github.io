  <h1>CLASSES &amp; CONSTRUCTORS</h1>

    <p</p>
    <p>I got into programming by experimenting with JavaScript but I was a beginner at best. Now, coming back to it after diving into Ruby, I have a much better understanding of its strong and weak points. It is not as object oriented as Ruby, and as a result its approach to object construction seems more like something that was slightly jury rigged as opposed to being a building block of the language.</p>
    <p>Classes and constructors are essentially templates for object creation. So Ruby has this special type of object that allows you to directly associate variables and methods with each new instance. JavaScript on the other hand allows you to use a function as a constructor to create variables that serve as properties which can point to data or functions or prototype properties. Whhhaaat! Even just comparing the concepts in plain English you can see that Ruby has the more elegant, natively object oriented solution. Lets compare syntax...</p>
    <h3>HOW DO YOU CHOOSE</h3>
    <p>So where do modules come in when writing your own classes and methods? In the Well Grounded Rubyist, David Black gives a couple of handy guidelines to help you make good choices. The most important one we already talked about, grouping like behaviors that may fit in in several different classes--and many times modules are named to indicate this, they are adjectives and objects are nouns by convention. Choosing modules and working with them effectively is a big topic, but hopefully this little intro will help jumpstart my understanding!</p>
