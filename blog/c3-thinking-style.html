    <h3>LEARNING</h3>
    <p>
      I can't believe that it has only been 3 weeks since I started this thing. Because of the amount of material that we've covered and the way I have approached it, I feel like I've spent atleast half a semester in Phase 0. At any of the three institutions of higher learning I have attended, the first three weeks of a semester would barely scratch the surface of what I have learnt here. Before this experience began I had two fears about my ability to learn &emdash; 1.had I lost it as I had gotten older? 2. did I ever really have it to begin with?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have the answers! Once I got the first week under my belt, I knew then that I hadn't lost my ability to learn complex material. And as to not having it in the first place, well I think that mostly has to do with not caring about the material until now and never developing study habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that the material isn't going to get any easier, but with unit 1 coming to a close, I am now confident that I can re-learn how to learn.
    </p>
    <h3>THINKING STYLE</h3>
    <p>
      I think the Gregorc Thinking style tests are like horoscopes. When you read horoscopes you can almost always find something about your self and your current situation in what they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that his work isn't valuable. For me, the value lies in reading and researching the individual characteristics of each thinking style and asking questions about how they apply to me. Acknowledging that I may have a tendency to monopolize a conversation or have difficulty expressing my emotions has less to do with being an abstract sequential thinker and more to do with being human developing certain ways to deal with all of the infinitely complicated personalities in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, I think that I am learning to recognized the parts of my thinking style that don't serve me well in any learning or working environment. Here is a few of them and how I will try to address them:
      <ul>
        <li>LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE - This can be mitigated by knowing the material forwards, backwards and sideways. The more that I have ownership of the material, the more I feel that I can offer and the more confidence I will have.</li>
        <li><a class="body_link" href="http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/breaking-the-perfectionism-procrastination-infinite-loop">PERFECTIONISM/PROCRASTINATION LOOP</a> - This article is totally me. I re-read it every once in a while just to remind myself not to go down that road. Tackling the hardest things first and timeboxing helps me stay on track with this.</li>
        <li>KNOW IT ALL-NESS - This is hard, especially in the context of pairing when you happen know a little more about a topic than someone else. I need to keep this in check so I don't become a driver cum navigator every time I pair. I know its wierd to have this one combined with the first one, but thats just how dichotomous humans can be.</li>
      </ul>
