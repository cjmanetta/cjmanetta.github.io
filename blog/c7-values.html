  <h1>TAKING MY OWN ADVICE</h1>
  <h2>SAT 5/23/2015</h2>
  <section>
    <p>I have been to a few crossroads in my life--times where I had to make a decision one way or another even if I didn’t recognize it at the time. I’ve had enough of these moments to know that a few things need to happen for me to make my way out of it a better, happier person. I have to be self-aware and I have to be honest with myself and other people. Those are the values I don’t seem value enough but when I come around to them everything is aces.</p>
    <p>In the past 5 years I have been trying on a little more honesty for size and that includes when I am asked for advice. Here’s what I do, I take their issue try to boil it down and rephrase it using their own words and then I serve it back to them like this:</p>
    <p>Do you think you could tell ____ that you feel this way about ____?</p>
    <p>Most people will give you atleast one reason why they can’t do it- but thats not the point. By asking the question I am trying to encourage them  to ask it of themselves. I’m not trying to offer them a fix and I have trained myself not to get disappointed if the suggestion doesn’t sink in. Its about helping them find their own way around the road blocks that emotional situaitons construct for us. To me thats the only honest thing to do when someone asks for that kind of advice.</p>
    <p>Of course the old adage applies here, the hardest thing is to take your own advice. At DBC or anywhere, if I confront a problem with self awareness and honesty, dollars to donuts I’ll end up overcoming it. Let me see if I can come up with a concrete example to help me remember to return to my values when the road blocks come up.</p>
    <p>So imagine this - I’m at DBC in a pair and the stakes are high - we are up against a deadline and the material is unfamiliar. I ask myself if I am as reasonably prepared as my partner. The answer comes back, yes...But he is a guy who probably was the first person to raise his hand in every math class in his life. Thats intimidating, I’m not that person, I’m a slower thinker, maybe because I am a woman or maybe its because I had a nasty math teacher who thought that my lack of speed was a sign of my lack of intelligence.</p>
    <p>At this point I’ve probably wasted 10 full minutes of my life that I will never get back with this internal dialogue and I have talked myself out of being able to contribute to the pair because I think he thinks that I’m slow. So I remember that blog post that I wrote in week 7. I need to be self aware and I need to be honest.</p>
    <p>I am prepared for this challenge! I am not a slow thinker, I am a thorough thinker! I just need to be honest with my pair and stop having this maddening conversation in my head. DO IT CHARLOTTE!</p>
    <p> “Hey can you give me a few minutes to read through the material some more and wrap my head around this thing?”</p>
    <p>Thats pretty easy right?</p>
